- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zriby

Hello! I am Ahmed Zribi and my passion for programming, math and probability is unending. After graduating with a Masters in Computer & Electrical Engineering from Concordia University, I received extensive training from mthree in Python, SQL, Advanced Linux, SRE, and DevOps.

I am currently an employee of mthree where I work onsite with Morgan Stanley with different partners across technology to find solutions which allows for growth and revenue and manage risk and reduce costs by leveraging existing technologies, onboarding new technologies or building them.

I am presently interested in DevOps, Cloud technologies, and Stock trading. I am a constant and passionate learner with outstanding time-management skills, a team player, and leader with a strong mathematical and scripting background.
